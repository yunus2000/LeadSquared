1.You need to write as many test cases as possible for a simple software program which computes the eligible discount for a customer. Try to describe all possible scenarios in a tabular format. Do not worry about ‘login’ kind of test cases, and just focus on how you will validate discount calculation. These are the rules.

If the customer is new, and they are willing to sign up for a new loyalty card, they get a 15% discount on all their purchases on the day. Second if they are an existing customer and hold a loyalty card, they get a 10% discount. Third, if they have a discount coupon, they will get 20% off which cannot be used with the new customer discount but can be used with loyalty card discount. Discount amounts are added, if applicable.

2.The following appeared as part of an article in the business section of a local newspaper:

"Ronnie’s Auto Repair Shop commenced business four months ago at the location formerly occupied by the Jenny’s Beauty Parlour. Ronnie’s Auto must be doing well at this location, because it intends to open a big shop in an adjacent town. Jenny’s, on the other hand, has seen a lower volume of business in its first year at its new location compared to the prior year at its former location. Jenny’s definitely erred in shifting to its new location; its former location is a better site.”

Discuss how well reasoned you find this argument. In your discussion be sure to analyse the line of reasoning and the use of evidence in the argument. For example, you may need to consider what questionable assumptions underlie the thinking and what alternative explanations or counterexamples might weaken the conclusion. You can also discuss what sort of evidence would strengthen or refute the argument, what changes in the argument would make it more logically sound, and what, if anything, would help you better evaluate its conclusion.
